=== About Knotebooks ===
Simply put, Knotebooks is a science education platform that allows both students and teachers to reuse, remix and redistribute Open Educational Resources to custom build curricula. 

A knotebook, a sort of “textbook 2.0,” is comprised of several “knotes,” or stand-alone sections that cover individual concepts within a scientific topic. Like a scientific paper, each knotebook contains an abstract, appropriate links and full reference section. Each knote has an author-defined difficulty level and crowd sourced rating, and since all content on the site is free to use under a Creative Commons license, any knote can be edited for style or content or completely repurposed to suit the author’s needs. Though this flexibility at the creation level is remarkable in its own right, the most innovative aspect of the platform is the level of customization available to the reader. Be it a student looking at a teacher’s knotebook or a teacher browsing someone else’s work, a user can swap out any knote for one that’s higher quality, a more appropriate difficulty level, or a different medium. They can even do a practice example, watch a video or see a computer simulation on the same concept without ever having to leave the page. The user can then save the personalized knotebook to their favorites in the form they find most instructive.

Content on a collaborative reference site like Wikipedia tends to evolve to only the most complex explanation, as if denser is somehow always better. By allowing a sort of “layered wiki” where multiple versions at varying difficulty levels can be seamlessly interchanged, Knotebooks creates fully referenced, independent evolution paths of high-quality content.
